# Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing to WordOps.

We love to receive contributions. Maintaining a CLI tool for deploying WordPress with Nginx with a few key strokes require to have enough knowledge for each stack configuration and to work with non-interactive operations. We rely on community contributions and user feedback to continue providing the best CLI tool to deploy WordPress with Nginx, PHP-FPM, MariaDB and Redis.

There are many ways to contribute, with varying requirements of skills, explained in detail in the following sections.
